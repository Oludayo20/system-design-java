# Monolithic Architecture — BlogStack (Java / Spring Boot)

Project 7 of the system design series. Java/Spring Boot port of the NestJS `07-monolithic-architecture`
project. This one demonstrates the **plain monolith**: one codebase, one process, one deployment,
one shared database — and modules that call each other's services directly because nothing stops
them.

## Concept, in my own words

A monolith is just an application shipped as a single deployable unit:

- **One codebase** — every module (`auth`, `users`, `posts`, `comments`, `notifications`) lives in
  the same `src/main/java/com/systemdesign/blogstack` tree, in the same repository.
- **One process** — one JVM process, one `BlogstackApplication` entrypoint, one running container.
- **One deployment** — `docker build . && docker run ...` ships all five modules at once. You
  cannot deploy a fix to `comments` without redeploying `auth` too.
- **One shared database** — every module's tables live in the same PostgreSQL database, in the
  same `public` schema, with real foreign keys crossing module lines (`comments.post_id ->
  posts.id`, `comments.user_id -> users.id`, `notifications.recipient_id -> users.id`).
- **Direct, in-process calls** — when one module needs another module's logic, it injects that
  module's `@Service` bean and calls a method on it. No event bus, no message queue, no HTTP hop,
  no interface contract. It's just a method call, so it's fast and simple to write — and it also
  means a bug or an outage in one module's code path can take down a request that otherwise had
  nothing to do with it.

This is deliberately the **naive** monolith — "everything calling everything" — before introducing
a modular monolith with strict boundaries and domain events.

## Unlike 01-modular-monolith

`01-modular-monolith` forbids modules from reaching into each other and communicates via domain
events (RabbitMQ) — Basket never imports Ordering's repository, Ordering never imports Basket's
service methods for anything but a narrow, exported contract. This project shows the classic
monolith that comes before that discipline: modules call each other's Spring beans directly.
`CommentsService` injects `PostsService`, `UsersService`, and `NotificationsService` and calls
`PostsService.findById()`, `UsersService.findById()`, and
`NotificationsService.notifyNewComment()` as plain method calls — not HTTP requests, not published
events, not even an interface boundary between them. That's the tradeoff this project exists to
make concrete: it's simpler to write, and it's also how one module's bug becomes every module's
outage.

| doc concept | Where it lives in this repo |
|---|---|
| One repository, one deployment, `docker build . && docker run` | Single `src/` tree, single `Dockerfile`, single `docker-compose.yml` `api` service |
| "Everything calling everything" (the *bad* monolith) | `CommentsService` injects `PostsService`, `UsersService`, and `NotificationsService` and calls their methods directly — see `src/main/java/com/systemdesign/blogstack/comments/CommentsService.java` |
| Every module stores its data in PostgreSQL, single shared database | One Postgres instance, one database, no schema-per-module split — see `src/main/resources/db/migration/` |
| JWT auth / Auth module | `src/main/java/com/systemdesign/blogstack/auth` (register, login, jjwt, BCrypt via Spring Security's `PasswordEncoder`) |
| "If Notifications breaks, the request that triggered it breaks too" | `CommentsService.create()` calls `NotificationsService.notifyNewComment()` synchronously, in the same request, after saving the comment |

## Run it

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

Swagger: `http://localhost:3007/docs`

### Try it

```bash
BASE=http://localhost:3007

# 1. Register
curl -s -X POST $BASE/auth/register \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"jane@example.com","password":"S3curePassword!","displayName":"Jane Doe"}' | tee /tmp/register.json

TOKEN=$(node -e "console.log(require('/tmp/register.json').accessToken)" 2>/dev/null || \
  python3 -c "import json;print(json.load(open('/tmp/register.json'))['accessToken'])")

# 2. Login (same credentials, issues a fresh token)
curl -s -X POST $BASE/auth/login \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"jane@example.com","password":"S3curePassword!"}'

# 3. Confirm the token resolves to a profile
curl -s $BASE/users/me -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# 4. Create a post
curl -s -X POST $BASE/posts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"title":"Why plain monoliths still ship products","body":"One repo, one deploy, direct calls."}' | tee /tmp/post.json

POST_ID=$(node -e "console.log(require('/tmp/post.json').id)" 2>/dev/null || \
  python3 -c "import json;print(json.load(open('/tmp/post.json'))['id'])")

# 5. Register a second user and comment on the first user's post
curl -s -X POST $BASE/auth/register \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"amir@example.com","password":"S3curePassword!","displayName":"Amir Musa"}' | tee /tmp/register2.json

TOKEN2=$(node -e "console.log(require('/tmp/register2.json').accessToken)" 2>/dev/null || \
  python3 -c "import json;print(json.load(open('/tmp/register2.json'))['accessToken'])")

curl -s -X POST $BASE/posts/$POST_ID/comments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN2" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"body":"Great breakdown of the tradeoffs!"}'

# 6. List comments on the post (public, no auth)
curl -s $BASE/posts/$POST_ID/comments

# 7. Confirm the comment triggered a notification: log in as Jane (the post owner) and
#    check her notifications — CommentsService called NotificationsService directly in step 5.
curl -s $BASE/notifications/me -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

Step 7 should return a notification row like:

```json
[{ "message": "Amir Musa commented on your post \"Why plain monoliths still ship products\"", "read": false, "...": "..." }]
```

That row exists because `CommentsService.create()` called `NotificationsService.notifyNewComment()`
directly, in the same request that saved the comment — not because a worker picked up an event
sometime later.

## The downside, made concrete

**A typo redeploys everything.** Say someone fixes a copy-editing typo in the comment validation
message in `CreateCommentRequest`. There's no way to ship just that change: `docker build . &&
docker run` rebuilds and redeploys the *entire* BlogStack image — `auth`, `users`, `posts`, and
`notifications` all restart too, even though none of their code changed. Every deploy is an
all-or-nothing deploy of five modules, forever, no matter how small the change.

**You can't scale the hot module alone.** Suppose `POST /posts/{id}/comments` gets hammered
because a popular post is trending, while `auth` and `posts` traffic stays flat. In this project
there is exactly one deployable unit — the `api` service in `docker-compose.yml` — so the only
lever you have is running more copies of the *whole application*. Every replica you add to handle
comment load also duplicates idle `auth`, `users`, and `notifications` capacity you didn't need.
Compare that to extracting `comments` into its own service (or even just its own scaling group):
you'd size it for its own traffic instead of over-provisioning the rest of BlogStack to keep up.

**One module's outage is every module's outage.** Because `CommentsService.create()` calls
`NotificationsService.notifyNewComment()` synchronously in the same request, an unhandled error or
a slow/locked `notifications` table doesn't just fail notifications — it fails the comment the
user was trying to post, even though the comment itself saved successfully. There is no retry
queue, no dead-letter table, no "notifications are degraded but the rest of the app is fine." The
failure domain of the whole monolith is the failure domain of its slowest, buggiest module on any
given request.

## Tests

```bash
mvn test
```

`CommentsServiceTest` (`src/test/java/com/systemdesign/blogstack/comments/CommentsServiceTest.java`)
is a plain Mockito unit test — no Spring context — that asserts `CommentsService` calls
`PostsService.findById()`, `UsersService.findById()`, and
`NotificationsService.notifyNewComment()` directly and synchronously, skips the notification when
users comment on their own post, and propagates `NotFoundException` from `PostsService` without
ever saving a comment.
