# Microservices Architecture — BookHive (Java / Spring Boot)

Project 8 of the system design series. `01-modular-monolith` and `04-ecom-marketplace-capstone`
built **modular monoliths** — one repository, one deployment, modules talking to each other
in-process. This project is the opposite: a small online bookstore, **BookHive**, split into
five independently deployable Spring Boot applications, each with its own database (where it
has one at all), that only ever talk to each other over the network. It is a Java/Spring Boot
port of the NestJS/Express `system-design/08-microservices-architecture` project — same
services, same endpoints, same fault-isolation demonstration, Spring idioms throughout.

## Concept, in my own words

A microservice is a service that:

- Does **one thing** (auth, catalog, orders, notifications — not "the backend")
- Owns **its own data** — no other service can query its database, because no other service has
  its connection string
- Is **built, deployed, and scaled independently** of every other service
- Talks to other services **over the network** (HTTP here; could be gRPC, or a message queue for
  async cases) instead of importing their code and calling a function

That last point is the whole architectural shift. In a modular monolith, `OrderingService` calls
`CatalogService.reserveStock()` — a Java method call, same process, same JVM, same transaction if
you want one. In microservices, `order-service` calls `catalog-service` — an HTTP request across
a Docker network, a different process, a different failure mode. You trade in-process simplicity
for independent deployability, and you take on everything that comes with a network in the
middle:

| You get | You pay for |
|---|---|
| Deploy `notification-service` without touching anything else | Every call can now time out, drop, or arrive twice |
| Scale `catalog-service` to 3 replicas without scaling `auth-service` | Retries, timeouts, and fallbacks are now *your* problem per call, not a language feature |
| A bug in one service can't corrupt another service's schema | Debugging one user request means reading logs across 5 processes, not one stack trace |
| Small, focused codebases per team | More moving parts: 5 apps, 3 databases, 1 gateway, all versioned separately |
| A service that's down doesn't have to take the whole system down (see "Fault isolation" below) | You have to *design* for that — it isn't free, see `order-service`'s notification call |

### The bad/good example this whole project demonstrates

> **Bad:** Orders Service directly queries the Catalog/Payment database.
> **Good:** Orders Service calls Catalog Service over HTTP.

`order-service` needs a book's price and current stock to place an order. It does **not** have a
`CATALOG_DB_*` environment variable anywhere — check `docker-compose.yml` or
`order-service/src/main/resources/application.yml` — so direct-database-access isn't a
discipline problem being avoided by convention, it's structurally impossible: the credentials
simply are not in that container. Instead it calls `POST /books/{id}/reserve` on
`catalog-service` over HTTP (`order-service/.../catalog/CatalogClient.java`).

```bash
# Proof: order-service has no catalog-db (or auth-db) connection info at all.
docker compose exec order-service env | grep -i db
# ORDER_DB_HOST=order-db
# ORDER_DB_PORT=5432
# ORDER_DB_USER=bookhive
# ORDER_DB_PASSWORD=bookhive_dev_password
# ORDER_DB_NAME=order_db
# (nothing about catalog-db or auth-db - it literally cannot connect to either)
```

   Each Postgres container is reachable ONLY by the one service that owns it.
   No service holds another service's DB credentials - see docker-compose.yml.
```

Identity flows without a network call: every Spring Boot service (auth, catalog, order)
independently verifies JWTs against the same `JWT_SECRET` — `order-service` never calls
`auth-service` to check who's calling it, it just decodes the bearer token the gateway
forwarded. This is the same trick `04-ecom-marketplace-capstone` uses to let its two API
instances validate tokens with no shared session store — applied here across process boundaries
instead of just across replicas. `auth-service`'s `JwtService` both signs and verifies; the
other two services carry a leaner `JwtVerifier` that can only verify — neither has any way to
mint a token.

## Endpoints

All routes below work identically through the gateway (`http://localhost:3008`) or hit directly
(`http://localhost:<service-port>`) — the gateway is the intended path, direct ports exist for
debugging.

### Gateway — `:3008`

| Method | Path | Forwards to |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/health` | (gateway itself) |
| * | `/auth/*` | auth-service |
| * | `/books*` | catalog-service |
| * | `/orders*` | order-service |
| * | `/notifications*` | notification-service |

### Auth Service — `:4001` (Swagger at `/docs`) — owns `auth-db`

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/auth/register` | — | Create a user, receive a JWT |
| POST | `/auth/login` | — | Receive a JWT |
| GET | `/auth/verify` | Bearer | Verify a token by hand |

### Catalog Service — `:4002` (Swagger at `/docs`) — owns `catalog-db`

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/books` | Bearer | Add a book |
| GET | `/books` | — | List books |
| GET | `/books/{id}` | — | Get one book |
| POST | `/books/{id}/reserve` | Bearer | Atomically decrement stock (called by order-service) |

### Order Service — `:4003` (Swagger at `/docs`) — owns `order-db`

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/orders` | Bearer | Place an order — calls catalog-service, then notification-service |
| GET | `/orders` | Bearer | List your orders |
| GET | `/orders/{id}` | Bearer | Get one of your orders |

### Notification Service — `:4004` (Swagger at `/docs`) — no database

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/notifications` | Record a notification (called by order-service) |
| GET | `/notifications` | Inspect everything "sent" so far |
| GET | `/health` | Liveness probe |

## Run it

> **Hosting & deployment:** See [HOSTING.md](./HOSTING.md) for prerequisites, per-component
> notes, and production tooling.

This spins up 9 containers (5 apps + 3 Postgres + implicit gateway) — like
`04-ecom-marketplace-capstone`, give Docker a few GB of RAM.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

Wait for all services to report healthy (`docker compose ps`), then hit the gateway at
`http://localhost:3008`.

### Try it

```bash
BASE=http://localhost:3008

# 1. Register
curl -s -X POST $BASE/auth/register -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"reader@bookhive.dev","password":"hunter22","fullName":"Ada Lovelace"}' | tee /tmp/register.json

TOKEN=$(jq -r .accessToken /tmp/register.json)

# 2. (Or login instead, once registered)
curl -s -X POST $BASE/auth/login -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"reader@bookhive.dev","password":"hunter22"}'

# 3. Create a book via catalog-service
curl -s -X POST $BASE/books -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"title":"The Pragmatic Programmer","author":"Hunt & Thomas","priceCents":3500,"stock":10}' \
  | tee /tmp/book.json

BOOK_ID=$(jq -r .id /tmp/book.json)

# 4. Place an order - order-service calls catalog-service over HTTP to reserve stock
curl -s -X POST $BASE/orders -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"bookId\":\"$BOOK_ID\",\"quantity\":2}"

# 5. Confirm notification-service saw it (order-service called it fire-and-forget)
curl -s $BASE/notifications

# 6. Fault isolation: stop notification-service, place another order, prove it still succeeds
docker compose stop notification-service
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' -X POST $BASE/orders -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d "{\"bookId\":\"$BOOK_ID\",\"quantity\":1}"
# -> still 201 Created. Check order-service logs: it logged the notification failure
#    and moved on instead of failing the order.
docker compose start notification-service
```

### Independent scaling

```bash
docker compose up --build --scale catalog-service=3
```

**Caveat that is actually true of this compose file:** `catalog-service` has a fixed host port
mapping (`4002:4002` in `docker-compose.yml`). Scaling it to 3 replicas will start all 3
containers, but only the first one can bind host port 4002 — the second and third will fail to
start with a port-already-allocated error, unless you first remove or templatize that port
mapping (e.g. `ports: ["4002"]` for a random host port per replica, or drop the `ports:` block
entirely and only reach catalog-service through the gateway). The replicas *would* all be
reachable from `gateway` and `order-service` on the internal Docker network regardless — that
network path doesn't go through the host port at all — it's only direct host access to the extra
replicas that the fixed mapping blocks.

### Independent deployment

Found a bug in `notification-service`? Rebuild and redeploy only it:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d notification-service
```

Nothing else restarts — `gateway`, `auth-service`, `catalog-service`, `order-service`, and all
three databases keep running untouched. Compare that to a monolith, where shipping any change
means rebuilding and redeploying the whole application.

### Fault isolation

```bash
docker compose stop notification-service
# ... place an order (see "Try it" step 6 above) ...
# It still returns 201. order-service's fire-and-forget call to notification-service
# has a NOTIFICATION_TIMEOUT_MS budget (default 2000ms) and swallows any failure -
# see order-service/.../notification/NotificationClient.java.
docker compose start notification-service
```

This is implemented for real, not just asserted: `NotificationClient.notifyOrderCreated` wraps a
`java.net.http.HttpClient` call in a try/catch fed by a per-request `HttpRequest.timeout(...)`,
logs a warning on any failure (timeout, connection refused, non-2xx), and returns normally
either way. `OrdersService.placeOrder` calls it purely to log the outcome — its own success was
already decided by the catalog reservation and the order-db write that happened before it.

## Tests

```bash
cd auth-service && mvn test      # or catalog-service / order-service
```

`gateway` and `notification-service` don't carry meaningful unit tests — the "Try it" curl
walkthrough above *is* their test; they're thin enough (a reverse proxy, an in-memory list) that
testing them in isolation would mostly test Spring MVC itself.
