# Serverless Architecture — A Hand-Built Local FaaS Emulator (Java port)

Project 10 of the system design series. This one demonstrates **Serverless Architecture**: you
write small functions with an AWS-Lambda-shaped handler signature `(event, context) -> response`;
a platform invokes them only when triggered; the platform manages scaling; and you pay only for
execution time.

> | **Real** | Actual added cold-start latency, measured with `System.nanoTime()` and injected with a real `Thread.sleep`-ed delay — provable with `curl`'s own timing. Actual scale-to-zero: a background sweeper really evicts idle instances and they are really gone (the next invocation is really cold again). Actual per-invocation timing and billing math, computed from real wall-clock handler duration. Actual concurrent burst handling: a burst of queue messages really does spin up multiple concurrent logical execution instances, not a canned log message. |
> | **Simulated** | There is no real S3, EventBridge, Lambda runtime, or API Gateway. `resizeProductImage` doesn't touch a real image. "Execution environments" are logical objects inside one JVM process, not real containers/microVMs. `POST /_simulate/s3-upload` exists only because there's no real S3 bucket to drop a file into locally. |

## Concept, in my own words

Serverless (FaaS — Function as a Service) means you stop thinking about servers and think about
functions instead:

1. **You write a function**, not a server. It takes an `event` (what triggered it) and a
   `context` (metadata about this invocation) and returns a response — that's the whole contract.
2. **The platform invokes it only when triggered.** No trigger, no running process, no cost. An
   HTTP request, a message landing on a queue, a schedule firing, a file being uploaded — any of
   these can be the trigger.
3. **The platform manages scaling.** One request or ten concurrent requests — the platform
   decides how many copies of your function to run. You never provision capacity.
4. **You pay only for execution time**, billed in small rounded-up increments (AWS Lambda bills
   in 1ms increments today; classic Lambda billing — and this demo — rounds to 100ms), not for
   idle time. A function that never runs costs nothing.
5. **Cold starts** happen because "no server running" is the whole point — when a function hasn't
   run recently, there's no warm process sitting around to handle the next invocation. The
   platform has to spin up a fresh execution environment first: load your code, run any
   initialization (open connections, read config), then run your handler. That setup cost is the
   cold start. If the same function is invoked again soon after, the platform reuses the
   still-warm environment and skips all of that — a warm start.

### Serverless is an axis, not a replacement

The most common confusion: serverless is not "instead of microservices" or "instead of
event-driven architecture." It answers a completely different question than either of those.

| Architecture | Answers the question | Unit of deployment | How it scales |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Monolith** | How is the codebase organized? | One process, one deployable | Scale the whole thing (vertically, or as replicas) |
| **Modular monolith** | How is the codebase organized? | One process, internally partitioned into modules with clear boundaries | Same as monolith; a module can later be extracted |
| **Microservices** | How is the codebase organized? | Many independently deployable services, one per bounded context | Scale each service independently |
| **Event-driven architecture** | How do components communicate? | Producers publish events; consumers subscribe and react, decoupled from each other | Add more consumers of the same event stream |
| **Serverless (FaaS)** | How does the code actually run? | Individual functions, each invoked on demand | Platform scales invocations automatically, including to zero |

Two things fall out of that table:

- **Serverless is orthogonal to monolith vs. microservices.** That axis is about how you split
  code into deployable units. Serverless is about the execution model each unit runs under. You
  could deploy a monolith's request handler as a single big Lambda, or split a microservices
  fleet so each service's endpoints are their own functions — the trigger/scale/pay-per-use
  mechanics are the same either way.
- **Serverless is orthogonal but complementary to event-driven architecture.** Event-driven is
  about *how components talk to each other* (publish/subscribe). Serverless is about *how the
  listening code actually executes*. They pair naturally — "a queue message triggers a function"
  is both an event-driven hand-off and a serverless invocation at once, which is exactly what the
  queue trigger in this project demonstrates — but you can have either one without the other:
  a scheduled Lambda invoked by cron has no event-driven component, and an event-driven system
  built from long-running Kafka consumers has no serverless component.

```

Every trigger is a thin adapter that calls `manager.invoke(functionName, event)` — the same
method, regardless of what fired it. That's the point being demonstrated: triggers are just
different front doors onto one runtime.

| Piece | Where it lives | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Execution-environment manager | `runtime/ExecutionEnvironmentManager.java` | Warm instance pool, cold-start simulation, TTL sweeper, per-invocation billing, stats |
| Handler contract | `runtime/LambdaFunction.java`, `LambdaEvent.java`, `LambdaContext.java`, `LambdaResponse.java` | `(event, context) -> response` — the AWS-Lambda-shaped signature every function implements |
| RabbitMQ topology + manual-ack listener factory | `config/RabbitConfig.java` | Declares `payment-queue`, publishes JSON, manual ack for the queue trigger |
| `apiGateway` trigger | `triggers/ApiGatewayController.java` | HTTP -> `POST /orders` -> `createOrder` |
| File-drop trigger | `triggers/FileDropController.java` | `POST /_simulate/s3-upload` -> `resizeProductImage` (stands in for an S3 event notification) |
| Schedule trigger | `triggers/ScheduleTrigger.java` | `ScheduledExecutorService` timer -> `dailySalesReport` (stands in for an EventBridge cron rule) |
| Queue trigger | `triggers/QueueTrigger.java` | RabbitMQ `payment-queue` consumer -> `processPaymentQueueMessage`, fanned out onto a worker thread pool for real concurrency |
| Burst publisher (demo tooling) | `triggers/PaymentBurstController.java` | `POST /_simulate/payment-burst?count=N` — feeds the real queue trigger |
| `createOrder` | `functions/CreateOrderFunction.java` | Validates body, creates an order in the in-memory store, returns 201 |
| `resizeProductImage` | `functions/ResizeProductImageFunction.java` | Simulates a resize (sleep + fake output key) |
| `dailySalesReport` | `functions/DailySalesReportFunction.java` | Sums the in-memory order store, logs a report |
| `processPaymentQueueMessage` | `functions/ProcessPaymentQueueMessageFunction.java` | Processes one queue message per invocation |
| Shared backing store | `store/OrderStore.java` | In-memory store standing in for a real database (e.g. DynamoDB) — see the class Javadoc for why |

**Every class under `functions/` has zero framework code in it** — no Spring MVC types, no
spring-amqp types, nothing from `runtime/` beyond `LambdaEvent`/`LambdaContext`/`LambdaResponse`.
Each one only knows `(event, context) -> response`. That's what makes them portable: the same
handler logic could be adapted to a real AWS Lambda runtime without touching its core.

## Run it

> **Hosting & deployment:** see [HOSTING.md](./HOSTING.md) for the Docker setup and what it would
> take to run patterns like these against real serverless platforms. **API docs:** Swagger UI at
> `/docs` (springdoc-openapi).

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build -d
```

This starts:

| Service | Port | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `api` | `3010` | HTTP surface: `apiGateway` trigger, `_simulate` endpoints, `/_runtime/stats` |
| `rabbitmq` | `5673` (AMQP), `15673` (management UI) | Backs the queue trigger only |

Tune behavior in `.env`:

- `WARM_TTL_MS` (default `60000`) — how long an idle instance stays warm before scale-to-zero
- `COLD_START_LATENCY_MS` (default `400`) — real injected cold-start delay
- `SCHEDULE_INTERVAL_MS` (default `30000`) — how often `dailySalesReport` fires

### Try it — prove the cold start

```bash
# 1. First call — nothing warm yet, so this is a cold start. Time it.
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:3010/orders \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"customerId": "cust_1", "items": [{"sku": "sku_42", "qty": 2}]}'
```

Look at the response — both the headers and the JSON body carry the same proof:

```text
HTTP/1.1 201
X-Cold-Start: true
X-Billed-Duration-Ms: 500
...
{
  "order": { "id": "order_1", "customerId": "cust_1", ... },
  "runtime": { "functionName": "createOrder", "cold": true, "durationMs": 4xx, "billedMs": 500, ... }
}
```

```bash
# 2. Immediately call it again — the instance is still warm (well under WARM_TTL_MS).
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:3010/orders \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"customerId": "cust_1", "items": [{"sku": "sku_42", "qty": 1}]}'
```

```text
X-Cold-Start: false
X-Billed-Duration-Ms: 100
...
"runtime": { "cold": false, "durationMs": 0-1, "billedMs": 100, ... }
```

`durationMs` drops by roughly `COLD_START_LATENCY_MS` — that's the real injected delay
disappearing because no fresh instance had to be constructed this time.

```bash
# 3. Wait past WARM_TTL_MS (default 60s — lower it in .env for faster demos, e.g. WARM_TTL_MS=8000)
sleep 65

# 4. Call again — the sweeper already evicted the idle instance, so this is cold again.
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:3010/orders \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"customerId": "cust_1", "items": [{"sku": "sku_42", "qty": 3}]}'
# X-Cold-Start: true again
```

You can also watch the eviction happen in the logs in real time:

```bash
docker compose logs -f api | grep sweeper
# [sweeper] evicted createOrder instance=<uuid> (idle 61023ms > TTL 60000ms) — scaled to zero
```

```bash
# 5. See the accumulated billing and cold/warm counts across everything invoked so far.
curl http://localhost:3010/_runtime/stats
```

```json
{
  "createOrder": { "invocations": 3, "coldStarts": 2, "warmStarts": 1, "totalBilledMs": 700, "warmInstances": 1 },
  "resizeProductImage": { "invocations": 0, "coldStarts": 0, "warmStarts": 0, "totalBilledMs": 0, "warmInstances": 0 },
  "dailySalesReport": { "invocations": 4, "coldStarts": 1, "warmStarts": 3, "totalBilledMs": 400, "warmInstances": 1 },
  "processPaymentQueueMessage": { "invocations": 0, "coldStarts": 0, "warmStarts": 0, "totalBilledMs": 0, "warmInstances": 0 }
}
```

### Try it — the file-drop trigger

There's no real S3 locally, so this endpoint stands in for "S3 invoked Lambda on upload":

```bash
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:3010/_simulate/s3-upload \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"bucket": "oja-product-images", "key": "product-42/original.jpg"}'
# "outputKey": "product-42/original-resized.jpg"
```

### Try it — the queue-burst concurrency demo

```bash
# Publish 10 payment messages at once.
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:3010/_simulate/payment-burst?count=10'

# Watch the queue trigger consume them concurrently and report the burst.
docker compose logs -f api | grep queue-trigger
```

```text
[queue-trigger] message acked — cold=true billed=600ms
[queue-trigger] message acked — cold=true billed=700ms
[queue-trigger] message acked — cold=false billed=100ms
... (all 10 arrive and get acked in quick succession, not one at a time)
[queue-trigger] burst complete — peak concurrency=9, cold starts this burst=8
```

Cold billed durations land around `COLD_START_LATENCY_MS` (400) plus the ~80-200ms of simulated
payment-processing work, rounded up to the nearest 100ms — e.g. ~500-700ms. Because almost nothing
was warm yet, most of the 10 concurrent messages each spun up their own execution instance — the
same way Lambda scales out concurrent execution environments to drain an SQS backlog. It's normal
to see peak concurrency slightly below the burst size (e.g. 9 instead of 10): the fastest workers
can finish and return their instance to the warm pool before the last messages in the same burst
are even dequeued, so a couple of "warm" reuses happen organically within one burst. Run the burst
again immediately (before `WARM_TTL_MS` elapses) and you'll see an even bigger mix of
warm reuse and cold starts, since some of the first batch's instances are still idle-but-warm.

```bash
curl http://localhost:3010/_runtime/stats | jq '.processPaymentQueueMessage'
```

### Try it — the schedule trigger

No curl needed — it fires on its own every `SCHEDULE_INTERVAL_MS`:

```bash
docker compose logs -f api | grep -E 'schedule-trigger|dailySalesReport'
```

```text
[schedule-trigger] dailySalesReport scheduled every 30000ms (stands in for a cron/rate expression)
[dailySalesReport] report generated: {generatedAt=..., ordersProcessed=3, totalRevenue=6000}
[schedule-trigger] fired — cold=false duration=1ms billed=100ms
```

Create a few orders first (`POST /orders`), then watch the next scheduled firing pick up the
updated total.

### Stop

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

## Tests

```bash
mvn test
```

`src/test/java/com/systemdesign/faas/runtime/ExecutionEnvironmentManagerTest.java` proves, with
real timers and no Spring context, HTTP server, or RabbitMQ required: cold-then-warm behavior,
that cold-start latency is a real slept delay (not a label), TTL-based re-cold-starting,
100ms-rounded billing accumulation, and that concurrent invocations with nothing idle yet each get
their own instance.
